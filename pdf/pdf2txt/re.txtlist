â€¢ Scale-space keypoint detection: Points of interest are
identified across both the image and scale dimensions using
a saliency criterion. In order to boost efficiency of
computation, keypoints are detected in octave layers of
the image pyramid as well as in layers in-between. The
location and the scale of each keypoint are obtained in
the continuous domain via quadratic function fitting.
